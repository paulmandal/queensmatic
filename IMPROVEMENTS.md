## Possible Improvements
- Design assumes a rectangular LED strip arrangement - something more flexible would be cool, but overkill for now
- Define initial DB in .sql file instead of Python file
- Bidirectional communication with the uController for LED state
- Use Python classes for data received by the API
- Move JSON->Native (and vice versa) mapping into API-level (led-controller-api.py)
- Improve touch detection in Android app - determine which strip the user is touching then determine which LED using only that strip's views
- Unit Tests
- Integration Tests
- Circuit with more SMD components instead of through-hole
- Possibly relay to control LED strip power supply
- Color selection pallet in app
- Sleep mode in uController code - use SerialEvent()
