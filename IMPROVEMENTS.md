## Possible Improvements
- Design assumes a rectangular LED strip arrangement - something more flexible would be cool, but overkill for now
- Define initial DB in .sql file instead of Python file
- Bidirectional communication with the uController
- Use Python classes for data received by the API
- Move JSON->Native (and vice versa) mapping into API-level (led-controller-api.py)
- Move RGB and Brightness remapping to uController code
- Scoping in Arduino code - Arduino has some oddness going on there (don't want to define anything inside the loop())
- Structs in Arduino for message handling
- Break Arduino code into smaller files
- Unit Tests
- Integration Tests
