## Possible Improvements
- Design assumes a rectangular LED strip arrangement - something more flexible would be cool, but overkill for now
- Define initial DB in .sql file instead of Python file
- Bidirectional communication with the uController
- Use Python classes for data received by the API
- Move JSON->Native (and vice versa) mapping into API-level (led-controller-api.py)
- Scoping in Arduino code - Arduino has some oddness going on there (don't want to define anything inside the loop())
- Structs or classes in Arduino for message handling
- Break Arduino code into smaller files
- Improve touch detection in Android app - determine which strip the user is touching then determine which LED using only that strip's views
- Unit Tests
- Integration Tests
